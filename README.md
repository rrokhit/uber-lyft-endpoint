# uber-lyft-endpoint
This is an API that will return fare information for Uber and Lyft's services, where the user only has to input their pickup and destiantion once. It was adapted from my Python script that I wrote at StarterHacks 2020 into a Flask endpoint. Currently it prints out the results, I will be adjusting it so that it delivers accuate JSON data soon.
